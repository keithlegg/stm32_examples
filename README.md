# stm32_examples


Home for all my experiments with learning STM32

These are projects that need to be placed in the appropriate folders to work.

For example 1bitsy projects need to be placed in the /examples folder 

Some use the Standard Peripheral Library and some use LibopenCM3

Your milage may vary .
